            There are two types of objects in the JS
            1. Built-in Objects
                These are those objects which are provided by the JS itself. most common objects are String, Number, Boolean etc
            2. User defined objects
               Those objects which are defined by the user are called user defined objects.

            Lets create an user defined object
